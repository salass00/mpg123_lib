An AmigaOS shared library implementation of libmpg123. Currently based on the
1.25.4 version.

The altivec version of the library is untested as I do not have a machine with
an altivec unit.

Installation:

For generic FPU version:

Copy Libs/mpg123.library LIBS:

For altivec version

Copy Libs/mpg123.library.altivec LIBS:mpg123.library
